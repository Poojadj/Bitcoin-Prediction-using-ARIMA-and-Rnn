Abstract about the project :

This project aims at predicting Bitcoin price using ARMA, ARIMA and RNN.
Bitcoin is the longest running and most well known cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are relatively unpredictable compared to traditional financial instruments. The increase/decrease in Bitcoinâ€™s price with large percentages over short periods of time is an interesting phenomenon which cannot be predicted at all.This Project aims to predict the price of these Cryptocurrencies with Deep Learning using Bitcoin as an example so as to provide insight into the future trend of Bitcoin.
These predictions could be used as the foundation of a bitcoin trading strategy. To make these predictions, first take we will have to familiarize yourself with a machine learning techniques ARMA, ARIMA, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) .

Concluding Remarks

Bitcoin is a successful cryptocurrency, and it has been extensively studied in fields of economics and computer science. In this study, we analyze the time series of Bitcoin price with ARIMA, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Bayesian Regression,  using Blockchain information in addition to macroeconomic variables and address the recent highly volatile Bitcoin prices.
 
We wrote a custom algorithm to hopefully predict future prices for all of our listed digital cryptocurrencies similar to Bitcoin. If you are looking for crypto currencies with a good return on your investment, BTC could potentially be a profitable investment option for you.
